== Details for exercise 3

While local AST transformations require an additional file (the annotation class), they are often much easier to deal with.

=== Local AST Transformations

You need to create an annotation class that will be used to annotate the code. Like a regular Java +@interface+, this annotation should tell on which elements it is allowed. Take a look at the +@Bindable+ AST transformation, for example:

```groovy
@java.lang.annotation.Documented
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.SOURCE)
@Target({ElementType.FIELD, ElementType.TYPE})
@GroovyASTTransformationClass("groovy.beans.BindableASTTransformation")
public @interface Bindable {
}
```

You will notice the annotation is itself annotated with +@GroovyASTTransformationClass+, which takes as an argument the name of the AST transformation implementation class which will be instantiated and applied (at the appropriate compile phase) each time an annotation is found.

=== Tips and tricks

* Local AST transformations cannot be run before the +SEMANTIC_ANALYSIS+ phase. The reason is that before that phase, references to classes are not resolved, so the compiler is not able to know that the annotation is actually an AST transformation.

=== Comments

If you write a local AST transformation, it is recommanded that it's documented on the annotation class, while the javadocs for the implementation class will only give internal details on how it works.
